README files are vital front pages for projects and use markdown.

They should always be part of a GitHub project.

# Java Fundamentals
Before we cal all appreciate the greatness of Java, we need to understand the forces that drove the creation ( may the force be with you ) , the philosophy and design concepts.

## The Origins
It was conceived by ames Gosling, Patrick Naughton, Chris Warth, Ed Frank, and Mike Sheridan at Sun Microsystems in 1991. Java was originally called ‚ÄúQak‚Äù, why I do not know but I can tell you that‚Äôs an awful name üòÜ but was renamed ‚Äújava‚Äù in 1995.

The history of computer languages is not just one isolated events. But, it is a continuum process in which each language is influenced in one way or another by what came before them. In this regards, Java is no different.

The two language that form java closest are C and C++.  C and C++ are among yer most important computer languages ever invented and still widely used today. From C, java inherited its syntax, while object model is adapted from C++.

In addition, Java designers did not reinvented the wheel. Instead the further refined an already highly successful programming paradigm.  The modern age programming moved from C to C++ and then to Java.

## How Java Impacted the Internet
The creation of Java  simplified Internet programming, acting as a catalysts that drew legions of programmers to the web. Java innovated a new type of networked program called `applet`  , which changed the way the online world thought about content. Finally, Java solved the issue associated with Internet: portability and security.

## Object-Oriented Programming
At the heart of Java us object-oriented programming (OOP). OOP methodology is inseparable from Java, and all java programs are ( at least to some extent) are object-oriented. Because of the importance of OOP to Java. It is very useful to understand the OOP basic principles before you Java program.

!960s gave birth to structured programming. This is the method by languages such as C and Pascal (Don‚Äôt even ask me, I don‚Äôt know that language ü§£).  Structural language made it possible to write complex programs fairly easily.

OOP took the best ideas of structured programming and combined them with several new concepts. The result was different ways of organising a program. For simplicity, a program can be organised in one of two ways: around its code (what‚Äôs happening) or around its data (what‚Äôs being affected). Structured programming techniques are typically organised around code.

OOP work the other way around. They are organised around data, with the key principle being ‚Äúdata controlling access to code.‚Äù In OOP, you define the data and the routine that are permitted to act on the data. Thus, a data type defined precisely what sort of operation can be applied to that data.

To suspect the principles of OOP, all OOP languages including java, have three traits in common: encapsulation, polymorphism and inheritance.

### Encapsulation

It is a programming ,mechanism that binds together code and the data it manipulates, and that keeps both safe from outside interference and misuse. In an OOP language, code and data can be bound together in a such a way that a self-contained black box is created. Within the box are all necessary data and code.

Within an object, code, data or both maybe private to that object or public. Private data is known to be accessible by only another part of that object. That is private cannot be acceded by piece of program that exists outside the object. When code or data is public, then other parts of your program can access it even though it is defined within an object. Typically, the public parts of an object are used to provide a controlled interface to the private element f the object.

Java basics unit of encapsulation is the class. A class defines the form of an object. It specifies both that data and the code that will operate on that data. Java uses a class specification to construct objects. Objects are instances of a class. Thus, a class is essentially a set of plans that specify how to built an object.

The code and data that constitute a class are called members of the class. The code that operates on that data is referred to as member methods or just methods. Method is java term for subroutine.

### Polymorphism

Polymorphism (means ‚Äúmany forms‚Äù in greek) is the quality that allows one interface to access a general class of actions. The specific actions is determined by the exact nature of the situation.

More generally, the concept of polymorphism is often expressed by the phrase ‚Äúone interface, multiple methods.‚Äù This means that it is possible to design a generic interface to a group of related activities. Polymorphism helps reduce complexity by allowing same interface to be used to specify a general class of action.

### Inheritance

It is the process by which one object can acquire the properties of another object. This is very important as it support the concept of hierarchical classification.
