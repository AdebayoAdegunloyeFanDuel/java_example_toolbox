# Collections and their usage

Collections are simply ways of storing various data types.

## Which Collection to use and use and when?
When and where to use a particular data type is completely down to the data that you wish to store and its structure.

### Arrays

An array is a fixed size storage for data types. When working with primitive types, arrays can be up to 25% faster than using List types such as the ArrayList.

Essentially when looking at the speed of a program and when Java is used in a low memory device Arrays would likely be a preference.

### Lists Interface
Lists are and should be used for reference types i.e. class objects.

Lists do not need to be a defined size and will grow/shrink to the data needs. 

You will also have many more methods to help with managing the data within the lists.

it is also important to consider which type of List you wish to use.

All in all Lists are mostly used due to their flexibility.
